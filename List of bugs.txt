Completely froze client.
Has occured thrice!

[Known]
* Player saves are definitely broken.
* Following while attacking needs some tweaking.
* Combat needs to be fixed - players go inside their attackers often.
* Attacking while the player is moving seems to cause ^.
* Pathfinding is messy: during ranged combat, arrows drop at where monsters should actually be (behind obstacles) but the models itself stay many squares off.
* This ^ also sometimes causes the player to be attacked by an enemy which appears away from the player but is actually at a closer square from which melee is possible (arrow drop locations).
* Sometimes the players cannot attack their enemies at all.
* Auto-retaliate is broken (apparently only during melee)
* Multi-combat is possible ON the player in single-combat areas. Inability to attack anything when this happens (already under attack).
* Causing more damage than health seems to be possible (?) and health UI goes full health when this happens.
* Magic axes don't have any attack animations or death animations
* Lesser demons can walk into lava, causing them to be un-attackable from melee (while they can attack the player)
* Magic spells SEEM not to have projectiles because of the combat bugs.

[Unintended Behaviour]
* Attempting to spec without enough energy stops combat
* Skeletons do not drop items.
* Ghosts always seem to drop an axe.
* There are 2 ways to autocast spells, through the magic book and through staves.
