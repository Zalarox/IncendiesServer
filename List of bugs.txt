Completely froze client.

[Known]
* Player saves are definitely broken.
* Combat needs to be fixed - players go inside their attackers often.
* Sometimes the players cannot attack their enemies at all.
* Auto-retaliate is broken
* Multi-combat is possible ON the player in single-combat areas. Inability to attack anything when this happens (already under attack).
* Causing more damage than health seems to be possible (?) and health UI goes full health when this happens.
* Magic axes don't have any attack animations or death animations
* Lesser demons can walk into lava, causing them to be un-attackable from melee (while they can attack the player)

[Unintended Behaviour]
* Skeletons do not drop items.
* Ghosts always seem to drop an axe.
